tree matching:

send out a probe that branches only if the current node has matching outgoing
edges for every next edge in the tree, and if it reaches the end of it's path,
send a "path complete" message to the coordinator with the id of it's starting
vertex.  the coordinator knows how many leaf nodes there should be in the tree.
it keeps a count for each of the incoming messages from nodes with each vertex
id. every source vertex with > # of leaves "path complete" messages is the root
of a match.  After this, for all of the matches send a new round of probes that
send the actual matches themselves instead of just a count. in this way we avoid
communication issues. if we don't send the actual messages we can at least count
the number of matches immediately

to do subgraph matching, decompose into trees ???
